# Octree

**Exploring Tree data structures, for SPH nearest neighbor search.**

An [octree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree) is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly eight children. Octrees are most often used to partition a three-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into eight octants. Octrees are the three-dimensional analog of quadtrees.
